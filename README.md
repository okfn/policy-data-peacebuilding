# Draft: Policy Driver Document for Data Accessibility and User Friendliness in Peacebuilding

## Introduction
This policy driver aims to encourage data providers to make their data more accessible and
user-friendly for peacebuilders. By implementing these guidelines, data providers can
ensure that their data is not only available but also usable, ethical, and impactful in the
field of peacebuilding.

This document has been co-designed by peacebuilders coming together at the Austrian Forum
for Peace 4th July 2024, comprising representatives from the United Nations, OSCE,
peacebuilding organisations, the third sector, and activists.

## Main Guidelines
By adhering to the following guidelines, data providers can significantly enhance the accessibility,
usability, and ethical integrity of their data, ultimately supporting more effective and impactful
peacebuilding efforts.

### 1. Know the source
**Transparency:** Clearly identify the publisher of the data and the primary
beneficiaries. Understanding the source helps users assess the credibility and potential
biases in the data.

### 2. Limits of the Data
**Disclosure:** Provide clear information on the limitations of the data. This includes
the scope, accuracy, and any constraints that might affect its interpretation and use.

### 3. Methodology
**Documentation:** Explain the reasons for data collection, the methodologies employed,
and the tools used. Highlight any data invisiblesâ€”elements that may not be immediately
apparent but are crucial for understanding the dataset.

### 4. Gamification
**Interactive Tools:** Develop interactive platforms that allow users to engage with
the data. Encourage innovative presentations of data and offer creative ways for users
to explore and find the data they need.

### 5. Contingency Plans
**Data Contestation:** Establish clear procedures for contesting the data. Address
potential misuse and outline steps to mitigate negative impacts if the data is used
for harmful purposes.

### 6. Ethical Guidelines
**Ethics Framework:** Implement and adhere to a robust set of ethical guidelines. Ensure
that data collection, processing, and dissemination respect privacy, consent, and other
ethical considerations.

### 7. Exploration Date
**Validity Period:** Assign an exploration date to the data, similar to a use-by date,
to indicate the period during which the data is considered reliable and relevant.

### 8. Education Toolkits
**User Guides:** Provide comprehensive toolkits to educate users on how to effectively
utilise the data. Include tutorials, case studies, and best practice examples.

### 9. Related Datasets
**Contextual Links:** Offer links to related datasets that can provide additional context
or complementary information, enhancing the utility of the primary dataset.

### 10. Bias Assessment
**Bias Questionnaire:** Include a questionnaire to help users identify and understand
potential biases in the data. This transparency aids in more accurate and fair use of
the data.

### 11. Software Recommendations
**Open Source Tools:** Recommend free and open-source software for data analysis
and visualization. This ensures that all users, regardless of resources, can work with
the data.

### 12. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
**SDG Alignment:** Clearly indicate which SDGs the data supports. Use a green label
to highlight contributions to sustainability and global development goals.

### 13. Needs-Based Approach
**Purpose-Driven Data:** Start with the end-user&#39;s needs in mind. Ensure that the data
is collected and presented in a way that directly addresses relevant questions and
challenges in peacebuilding.

### 14. Do No Harm
**Safety Benchmark:** Adopt the &quot;do no harm&quot; principle as a fundamental benchmark
for data publishing. Ensure that data dissemination does not inadvertently cause
harm or exacerbate conflicts.

### 15. Code of Conduct
**Standards Compliance:** Develop and enforce a code of conduct for data providers,
ensuring compliance with ethical standards and best practices in data management.

### 16. Carbon Footprint
**Sustainability:** Evaluate and minimize the carbon footprint of data collection and
dissemination processes. Promote environmentally sustainable practices in data
management.

### 17. Positive Reinforcement
**Narrative Building:** Use data to create positive narratives and highlight successful
peacebuilding efforts. Encourage the sharing of stories and case studies that
demonstrate the impact of data-driven interventions.

### 18. Peer Review
**Quality Assurance:** Implement a peer review system for data before it is released.
This can be tied to new licensing mechanisms to ensure data quality and reliability.
